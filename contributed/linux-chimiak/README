This directory contains two files donated by Bill Chimiak of
Bowman Gray.  They are used for installation on Linux.  Since
we don't have a Linux machine, we have not been able to verify
these scripts.  If you have problems, I would send mail to
Bill (chim@medeng.bgsm.edu).  Forward any changes/fixes to
dicom_bugs@wuerl.wustl.edu  so we can incorporate them into future releases.

The file .makalinuxctn uses .linux.configure.  Note that these
begin with ., so don't miss them.
