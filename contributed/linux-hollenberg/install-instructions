        Directions for installing msql and CTN on linux to run DICOM

Editor's note:  These instructions were written for releases where
we included the msql software.  You now have to get that for yourself
from bond.edu.au.

  6.1.  linux/version.h: No such file or directory

  Can't compile any source file that includes ctype.h because
  /usr/include/linux/version.h doesn't exist.  The CND-kernel-source RPM
  is built wrong.

  Workaround: To create the version.h file, perform thefollowing steps
  as root:

  +  cd /usr/src/linux

  +  make include/linux/version.h

        adduser msql   /usr/sbin/adduser as root

        su

        passwd msql

        Ctrl-D

       # check GID for msql in /etc/passwd and record here _____

        move CTN-tar-file to /home/msql and untar

        cd /home

        su

        chgrp -R msql msql

        chown -R msql msql

        su - msql

        cd /home/msql/pd_software/msql-xxxx

        # check that libmsql.a is in "/home/msql/lib" if not copy
        # it there.

        make target

        cd targets

        cd Linux-1.2.13-i586    (or the appropriate target)

        ./setup

        make all

        make install

        cd /usr/local/Minerva/bin

        cp * /usr/local/Program_Groups/DICOM

        # check to see that UID and GID are msql.
        cd /usr/local/Program_Groups ; ls -l

        # check to see that UID and GID are msql.
        cd DICOM ; ls -l

        # if they are not, execute the next four commands

        cd /usr/local/Program_Groups

        su

        chgrp -R msql DICOM

        chown -R msql DICOM

        su - msql

        cd /home/msql/environments/linux/linux...env

        vi linux....env

        # "x" to delete a character, "a" to append,
        # "i" to insert
        # change line
        # "setenv DICOM_BIN $DICOM_ROOT/bin/linux.msql.noopt"
        # "setenv DICOM_BIN /usr/local/Program_Groups/DICOM"

        # Press "Esc"  ":wq" then ENTER to save

        csh

        source linux....env

        bash

        cd /home/msql/facilities

        make install

        cd ../apps

        make install

        Run your tests!
