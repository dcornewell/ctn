mySQL Installation Notes
------------------------

MySQL is a true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. The main goals of MySQL 
are speed, robustness and ease of use. It can be obtained from www.mysql.com. 
It is available in both binary and source versions for several platforms, 
including Windows (please check licensing policies).

Instructions for installing mySQL are included with the documentation and describe
system-specific problems you may encounter as well as post-installation issues, 
depending on your particular configuration.

Before using CTN, you must add a user to the mySQL system called ctn, with password 
ctn (you may change this editing tbl_mysql.h in the facilities/tbl directory) and give 
this user full permissions (select, insert, delete, update, etc.) on the CTN databases.
